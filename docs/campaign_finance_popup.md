Figures are based on itemized contributions reported to the Federal Election Commission and state agencies. Please note that:

- contributions under $200 are not reported, and so are not included in totals.
- only contributions from individuals and organizations to candidates are included. Various accounting measures and more exotic contribution types are excluded.
- contributions are matched based on organization and recipient name. Contributions reporting incorrect or non-standard versions of the name may be missed. Similarly, corporate name changes may cause contributions to be missed.
- organization totals include known subsidiaries of the organization.
