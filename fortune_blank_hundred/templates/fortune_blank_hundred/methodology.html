    <p >The Supreme Court's decision in Citizen United v. Federal Election Commission&#160;held that corporate speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of federal candidates&#8212;including TV and radio ads, pamphlets, calls from phone banks and other activities taken on by political campaigns&#8212;enjoy the full protection of the First Amendment. Subsequent court rulings and agency rulemakings gave birth to super PACs&#8212;political committees that can raise contributions in unlimited amounts from individuals and corporate entities&#8212;and led to an unprecedented flood of money from independent organizations attempting to influence electoral outcomes. </p>
    <p >The Sunlight Foundation has been at the forefront of tracking the flow of outside spending that the decision unleashed. We built the first tool that tracked this outside spending, &#8220;Follow the Unlimited Money,&#8221; that provided real-time information on super PAC filings. We have since expanded it to include all Federal Election Commission filings and renamed it Real-Time FEC. In 2010, we coined the phrase &#8220;dark money&#8221; to describe spending by subset of outside spending organizations&#8212;mostly nonprofits formed under 501(c)4 of the Internal Revenue Code&#8212;that don&#8217;t disclose their donors. Later, we built tools like PoliticalAdSleuth.com, which captures dark money expenditures on television ads that are not reported to the Federal Election Commission, and Political Ad Hawk, which catalogs their actual advertisements, in an effort to track all the &#8220;corporate speech&#8221; unleashed by Citizens United.&#160;</p>
    <p >In the wake of the 2012 presidential election, we began looking at other ways of assessing the decision&#8217;s impact on politics and government. Of particular interest to us were the theoretical underpinnings of the high court&#8217;s holding:</p>
    <ol>
            <li>1) That allowing corporations&#8212;whether for-profit or nonprofit&#8212;to spend directly from their treasuries to influence elections would not lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption, and</p>
            <li>2) that absent such a decision, government &#8220;muffle[d] the voices that best represent the most significant segments of the economy.&#8221;
    </ol>
    <p >The corruption/appearance of corruption standard comes from an earlier Supreme Court case, Buckley v. Vallejo, which held the Congress could limit the size and source of contributions to federal candidates in the interest of preventing corruption or the appearance of it. Independent expenditures&#8212;which are not coordinated with candidates or parties&#8212;would not create even the appearance of corruption in essence because candidates and parties would not get the money. </p>
    <p >The &#8220;muffled voices&#8221; doctrine comes from a dissent authored by Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in McConnell v. FEC, the case that upheld the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act&#8217;s ban on corporations, labor unions and even individuals from contributing &#8220;soft money&#8221; to political party committees. Scalia worried that barring corporate spending to influence elections would limit corporate influence over government decisions. &#8220;Imagine, then, a government that wished to suppress nuclear power--or oil and gas exploration, or automobile manufacturing, or gun ownership, or civil liberties--and that had the power to prohibit corporate advertising against its proposals.&#8221; </p>
    <p >The Citizens United opinion is far more complex than we are crediting here, but Fixed Fortunes set out to test those two premises. Did campaign finance laws muffle corporate voices from the most significant segments of the economy? Or did their influence, both before and after the decision, have an impact on policymakers that to a reasonable person would constitute an appearance of corruption (one &#8220;stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions,&#8221; in the words of the Buckley court). </p>
    <p >We set out to answer that question by looking at organizations that pay into politics, and determining what they get out of politics.</p>
    <h3>Influence spending</h3>
    <h4>Organization</h4>
    <p >To determine this, we looked at major for-profit corporations that contributed to political campaigns from the 2008 election cycle to the 2012 election cycle&#8212;the Citizens United&#160;decision was announced in January 2010, roughly at the middle of the period. We chose to focus on for-profit corporations with active political action committees in each of the three cycles and that had active lobbyists each of the three cycles. Determining which corporations made our list involved ranking them by the amount of money they contributed to federal political committees; we chose to look at the top 200 givers. </p>
    <p >For each corporation, we identified as many of their subsidiaries as we could by looking at company websites, annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news reports accessed online or via the Lexis-Nexis database, from the Center for Responsive Politics&#8217; extensive database of parent-child relationships and other sources. Particularly valuable for this purpose were Bloomberg Businessweek company snapshots, which often list the official date that merged or acquired entities officially became subsidiaries. For this project, we took a conservative approach and began including information for subsidiaries on that date, rather than the data on which the acquisition was announced, which is generally several months before the acquisition or merger is finalized. </p>
    <p >Generally speaking, we followed the organization names Center for Responsive Politics uses. In a few cases, companies that are part of the Fixed Fortunes group underwent significant change after the period we examined; for example, defense contractor Science Applied International Corp., or SAIC, split into two entities, one preserving the original name and a second called Leidos. That split, announced August 30, 2012, was not fully completed until 2013. We therefore have data on the original, unsplit SAIC.</p>
    <h4>Contributions</h4>
    <p >We downloaded data from the Center for Responsive Politics bulk data page, identified entities with political action committees, excluded labor unions, trade associations and other nonprofit groups, and then ranked the remaining for-profit donors by total campaign contributions&#8212;from their political action committees and their employees and their family members. We should add that we are grateful to the Center for Responsive Politics, who provided the data and critical guidance and assistance with our analysis. Any errors are of course our own.</p>
    <p >Next, we eliminated from our list of big donors law and lobbying firms, whose giving can sometimes be in the interest of clients rather on their own behalf: we will examine them separately. Then we determined which of our entities, in addition to having political action committees, also maintained active lobbyists through each of the three campaign cycles we looked at. We ended with a list of the top 500 entities.</p>
    <p >After reviewing our results, we also chose to exclude companies that gave 60 percent or more of their total, usually via executives, to super PACs, even if they met our other criteria. This eliminated a very few companies, including Sands Corporation, whose majority shareholder, Sheldon Adelson and his wife contributed more than $90 million to super PACs in the 2012 election alone, and Bain Capital, whose executives gave generously to Restore Our Future, the super PAC that supported their former colleague Mitt Romney. The pattern for giving for these entities was so significantly different than the rest of the sample that we chose to exclude them. We did included corporations whose parents did not have a political action committee, but had one or more subsidiary that did have a PAC.</p>
    <p >Let us further note for the record that, of course, labor unions, trade associations, law and lobbying firms, super PACs and political nonprofits also have huge impacts on elections and politicians. While this analysis focuses only on for-profit corporations, we certainly do not intend by that focus to imply that these are the only type of corporate entities whose influence that can lead to an appearance of corruption. Thirteen of the 25 biggest donors to federal candidates and party committees going back to 1989 are labor unions, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and five of them are trade associations. For this study, we chose to focus on for-profit corporations because we believed it would be easier to quantify what they get from government. </p>
    <h4>Lobbying</h4>
    <p >Once we developed our final list of the 200 for-profit corporate entities that had contributed the most to candidates and political parties over the six-year period, we added their total disclosed spending on lobbying, relying again on data from the Center for Responsive Politics bulk data download page. And here a note about the limitations of all the data we looked at and a huge caution for users of our numbers: Lobbying and other numbers used in this analysis are extremely imprecise due to the manner in which they are collected, processed (or not processed) and published.&#160;For-profit corporations, for example, can report lobbying expenditures using one of two different definitions. One, set forth in the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, requires reporting of expenditures on federal lobbying activities, while the other allows companies to use an Internal Revenue Code definition of lobbying and political expenses, including for influencing state and local politics. A company using the LDA definition that contributed $1 million from its treasury to a super PAC would not report that donation as a lobbying expense while a company using the tax code definition would. A company using the LDA definition would not report its $10 million contribution to a state-level committee opposing a ballot initiative, while a company using the tax code definition would. And a company using the LDA definition would not report the annual dues it pays to a trade association like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, while a company using the tax code definition would include the nontaxable portion of its donation that was used for political purposes. We included the disclosed spending on lobbying of each of the 200 companies we examined, but advise users that the numbers spent by different companies are not necessarily comparable. </p>
    <h4>Total Influence</h4>
    <p >Our total disclosed political spending consists of campaign contributions added to lobbying data. The total amount of federal influence spending could be higher, if corporations using the LDA definition are also contributing to trade associations and other politically active nonprofits, or lower, if corporations using tax code definitions are spending significant amounts of money influencing state and local expenditures. These are not the only limitations of the federal data we relied on that render make these numbers less than precise. We are more confident in the accuracy and comparability of the contribution figures. Unlike the lobbying data, the contribution data is all reported according to one set of rules. Thus, we ranked the companies by contribution data. </p>
    <h4>Hill Coverage</h4>
    <p >One of the things that struck us when looking at the giving of these organizations is that they gave to dozens of members of Congress. We queried our data to determine how many campaign committees of incumbent members of Congress&#8212;both the House and the Senate&#8212;received contributions from each company in each cycle, then averaged those three numbers to come up with a &#8220;Hill coverage&#8221; percentage. If corporations could find a way to contribute to a large percentage of members of Congress, presumably they could also make their policy preferences known to them.</p>
    <p >Federal Business: Both federal business and federal support are loosely defined categories consisting of multiple elements. The distinction is that federal business consists of funds that generally speaking do not have to be paid back, e.g., a contract to sell the military a tank, while federal support is money that does have to be paid back, like a loan from the Commodity Credit Corporation to an agribusiness to support sugar prices. </p>
    <p >While these represent disparate types of support at the taxpayers' expense -- and while government argues that the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the Export Import Bank actually turn profits for taxpayers -- what interested us was the total amount of dollars that the federal government offered to corporations. After all, as many homeowners or farmers could attest, not everyone who needed a loan from the federal government got one in time to save their assets during the recent financial crisis</p>
    <h4>Federal contracts, grants and loans</h4>
    <p >After considering several different data sources, each of which proved to be problematic, we reluctantly chose to use data from USASpending.gov. Sunlight has extensively criticized shortcomings of this dataset, including missing and inconsistently reported information. Even worse, not all agencies report information to USASpending.gov, leaving large gaps in disclosure. As short of perfection as the data is, we believe it undercounts rather than over counts federal contracting and assistance data, and that it is a better source of information than the Federal Procurement Data System. We searched for parents and subsidiaries, and added a standardized parent company name in an &#8220;orgname&#8221; field. Contracts were included in the federal business category, while grants and loans were included in federal support. The data includes spending that was funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the Stimulus. We excluded data from the Export Import Bank, because the bank releases more complete information on Data.gov.</p>
    <p >Export-Import Bank: We downloaded data from data.gov on Ex-Im Bank loan activity from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2013. We standardized names of primary exporters&#8212;the companies whose goods foreign purchasers borrow money loaned or guaranteed by the bank&#8212;in a field called primary_exporter_sunlight. We totaled the approved_declined_amount field for each company to determine the amount of sales facilitated by the Ex-Im Bank. We also standardized the names of lenders in a field called primary_lender_sunlight. Except where a primary exporter was among our 200 companies, we counted loan guarantees as federal support.</p>
    <h3>2008 Bailout and Beyond</h3>
    <p >In response to the financial crisis that peaked in September and October of 2008, the federal government took extraordinary measures to support financial firms and a few other large corporations. With the exception of Lehman Brothers, which collapsed into bankruptcy in September 2008, the federal government chose to rescue as many firms as it could, directing the bulk of its aid to the biggest firms. We examined Treasury and Federal Reserve programs that were the vehicles for that aid.</p>
    <h4>AIG Counterparties</h4>
    <p >As part of the rescue of American International Group, the Treasury Department authorized the giant insurer to pay about $125 billion borrowed from taxpayers to other financial firms with which it had entered into credit default swaps. We used the original documents AIG released in March 2009 to construct a spreadsheet showing who among our 200 Fixed Fortunes companies received money under the deal. Included in federal business.</p>
    <h4>Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) purchases</h4>
    <p >AMLF was one of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s programs to ease the liquidity crisis that followed the collapse of the housing bubble. It had two classes of beneficiaries: 1. Money market mutual fund managers held pooled investments of mortgage, auto, student loan and other debt that they couldn&#8217;t sell, largely because no one knew the creditworthiness and ability to pay of the debtors. 2. Banks that purchased the asset-backed paper, using loans from the Federal Reserve. Loans to banks to purchase the paper were included in federal support; the fund managers who sold the paper were included in the federal business category. Data was downloaded from the Federal Reserve.</p>
    <h4>Capital Purchase Program</h4>
    <p >One of the components of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. We downloaded PDFs summarizing financial activity in the program from Treasury.gov and created our own spreadsheets showing the initial amount that Treasury provided, plus information on the mechanisms through which it was provided. Participants in the Capital Purchase Program issued preferred stock to Treasury in exchange for a cash infusion, as well as warrants to purchase common stock. We include data on the amount of stock, warrants, share price, repayment amount and profit or loss on each investment. </p>
    <h4>Automotive Industry Financing</h4>
    <p >Another component of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The information was downloaded from Treasury.gov as a PDF file and entered into a spreadsheet. General Motors was the only beneficiary of the program among the corporations we studied.</p>
    <h4>Targeted Investment Program</h4> 
    <p >Another component of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The information was downloaded from Treasury.gov as a PDF file and entered into a spreadsheet. Bank of America and Citigroup were the only beneficiaries of the program.</p>
    <h4>Term Auction Facility</h4>
    <p >One of the first of the bailout programs, the Term Auction Facility offered short-term loans to U.S. banks and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks that were eligible to borrow from the Fed&#8217;s discount window through its primary credit program. The Federal Reserve launched the Term Auction Facility in December 2007 to increase liquidity among banks, which were then already under pressure. Data downloaded from the Federal Reserve.</p>
    <h4>Term Securities Lending Facility</h4>
    <p >The Federal Reserve exchanged Treasury securities for &#8220;less liquid&#8221; securities, including mortgage-backed securities whose value was in doubt even ahead of the housing foreclosure crisis in 2008. Primary dealers&#8212;the largest financial institutions that act as counterparties for the Fed when it adjusts the money supply&#8212;were eligible to participate. Data downloaded from the Federal Reserve. </p>
    <h4>Commercial Paper Funding Facility</h4>
    <p >Corporations issue commercial paper to borrow money for short-term expenses. During the financial crisis, lenders were unsure which companies were creditworthy and which were likely to fail, so the Federal Reserve created the Commercial Paper Funding Facility to become a corporate bond buyer. The Fed created a limited liability company, CPFF LLC, to which it loaned money. CPFF, in turn, purchased commercial paper from companies. Data downloaded from the Federal Reserve.</p>
    <h4>Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility</h4>
    <p >The Federal Reserve loaned money to financial institutions in order to stimulate demand for asset-backed securities Firms issuing the securities were the main beneficiaries. Data downloaded from the Federal Reserve. Note: We excluded legacy asset backed securities from the analysis, because while the original issuer was listed, it was unclear whether the issuer was remained the owner at the time Federal Reserve funds were used to purchase the asset. </p>
