# API/data needs
* searches with spaces
* Metadata: Politician: picture, party, state, first elected, next election...
* Ability to filter results for all API calls by cycle
* top contributors from industry
* remaining types for top contributors and recipients
* breakdown, timeline calls
* entity_type in entity search results
* the entity_metadata call DOES return type, does NOT return ID. the entity_search returns ID and does NOT return type. 
*

general todo
* if we stick with google charts, properly urlencode all chart urls.
* clean up layout. 
* 

# to decide
* charting solution-- google charts aren't clickable.
