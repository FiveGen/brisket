* the cycle argument should persist when you follow a link from a page
  already displaying a specific cycle.
* change links to include human readable entity name [1]
* lobbying for organizations, politicians, [2]
* capitol words [3]
* lookup table for industry sector codes
* 

* details page
* sparklines
* make sure limit keyword works with top contrib/recipient calls
* sort search results by decreasing contrib. 
* decide on what to do for pages that have empty result sets for specific calls. 
* make barcharts display top 5 and then "other"

* add db tables to resolve industry and sector IDs to names
* brisket API wrapper needs to reflect new API calls. 
  eg. recipients_candidates could now either be from an individual or pac. 


* Metadata: Politician: picture, party, state, first elected, next election...
* remaining types for top contributors and recipients
* breakdown, timeline calls
* are available cycles added manually or automated?
* add support for all/multiple election cycles?


[1] ----------------------------------------
Clay requested that the name of the entity be visible in the
URL. Jeremy suggested that this would be easy to do by redirecting
from the standard http://brisket.com/politician/abcd1234.... to
http://brisket.com/politician/Al_Franken/abcd1234...

As long as the entity ID is there, the name wouldn't be meaningful to
the server--it's just there for the user. And if the entity ID isn't
on the end, then we can treat the name simply as a search. If there's
only one result, then we can go straight to that page.
