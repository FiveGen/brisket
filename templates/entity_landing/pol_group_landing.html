{% block description %}Political groups include groups whose sole purpose is to raise and spend money on political campaigns. This includes political action committees, super PACs, candidate committees and a number of other type of committees designated by the Federal Election Commission. Political groups also include political non-profits with an IRS designation of 501c(4). Political non-profits generally run television advertisements known as issue ads, which don't expressly advocate for the win or defeat of a specific candidate, but are intended to influence politics and political races.{% endblock %}
