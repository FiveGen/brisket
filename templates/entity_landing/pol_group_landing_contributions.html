            <p>The charts below display political groups' contributions to federal and state races.  For federal races, only political contributions over $200 are included in these totals. This is because the Federal Election Commission only requires campaigns to itemize contributions that are more than $200.  For state races, the threshhold for itemizing each contribution varies by state.</p>
